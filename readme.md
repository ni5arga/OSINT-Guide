# OSINT Guide

This repository is a collection of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools, techniques, and tricks designed to help uncover publicly available information.

## Reddit OSINT

Reddit activity can reveal a lot about a person. Here's how to analyze it effectively:

### User Profile Analysis

- https://redditmetis.com/ - Reddit user profile analysis tool, only fetches last 1000 submissions/comments (publicly visible) and gives that info. Can be used to get basic information about someone.
- https://reddit-user-analyser.netlify.app/ - Another Reddit profile analysis tool.

### View Deleted/Removed Content or Download Content

- https://arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com/ - View deleted/removed posts/comments of an user, very useful to know what they have deleted which might uncover more information about them.

- https://search.pullpush.io/ - Same like arctic shift. But a different service.

- https://undelete.pullpush.io/ + `r/subreddit` + `/postID/` - See deleted/removed comments of a thread or see a deleted/removed thread.
  
- https://arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com/download-tool - Download posts and comments from a subreddit or user.
  
## Phone Number

This part is mostly written based on indian numbers.

- https://truecaller.com - The OG resource for getting info about phone numbers. Heavily auth-walled recently (sometimes paywalled too).
