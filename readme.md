# OSINT Guide

A repository which contains OSINT tools and some methods/tricks.

## Reddit 

I have spent a sizeable amount of my time on Reddit, and here is how to find as much as information about someone from their reddit activity.

- https://redditmetis.com/ - Reddit user profile analysis tool, only fetches last 1000 submissions/comments (publicly visible) and gives that info. Can be used to get basic information about someone.

- https://arctic-shift.photon-reddit.com/ - View deleted/removed posts/comments of an user, very useful to know what they have deleted which might uncover more information about them.

- https://search.pullpush.io/ - Same like arctic shift. But a different service.

- https://undelete.pullpush.io/ + {thread slug} - See deleted/removed comments of a thread or see a deleted/removed thread.

## Phone Number

This part is mostly written based on indian numbers.

- https://truecaller.com - The OG resource for getting info about phone numbers. Heavily auth-walled recently (sometimes paywalled too).

### Truecaller Telegram Bots

## Instagram

- https://instaloader.github.io/ - tool to download pictures (or videos) along with their captions and other metadata from Instagram.
