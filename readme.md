# OSINT Guide

A repository which contains my notes on OSINT and some resources I have used. 

## Reddit 

I have spent a sizeable amount of my time on Reddit, and here is how to find as much as information about someone from their reddit activity.

- https://redditmetis.com/ - Reddit user profile analysis tool, only fetches last 1000 submissions/comments (publicly visible) and gives that info. Can be used to get basic information about someone.
